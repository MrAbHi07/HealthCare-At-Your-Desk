# HealthCare-At-Your-Desk
This is a front-end medical website project aiming to help hospitals manage patient-disease-doctor relationships, and assist patients in classifying their diseases and finding relevant doctors. it would benefit from backend integration, dynamic data, real user flows (login, booking), and possibly more advanced diagnostics.
According to the README, Doctello is a medical‐website designed to:

Help hospitals organise their services. 

- Allow patients to classify their disease and find the concerned doctors.
- It also mentions a special “System Checker” option to assist new patients in diagnosis/selection.
- In short: a front-end web project aimed at bridging patients, diseases and doctors for hospital management + patient self-service.



🧱 Technologies & Structure

- The languages used are HTML (~62.9%), CSS (~26.6%) and JavaScript (~10.5%). 
GitHub

- The file structure (as seen in the repo) includes folders: css, fonts, img, js, and root files like index.html, faq.html, etc. 
GitHub

- The README lists topics/tags such as web-development, medical, hospital-website, front-end-development, intermediate. 
GitHub

🎯 Use-Cases & Target Audience

- For hospitals (or clinics) looking to setup a web presence and integrate a patient-disease classification system.

- For patients who want to quickly identify potential diseases (via the “System Checker”) and find doctors accordingly.

- Could also serve a portfolio piece for web-development learners (front-end) since it is built with HTML/CSS/JS.

🔍 Strengths & Opportunities

Strengths:

- Clearly defined purpose: hospital + patient interface.

- Lightweight tech stack (HTML/CSS/JS) — easy to deploy or extend.

- Good portfolio project showing full site structure and real-world theme.

Opportunities / areas to expand:

- If not yet present: integrate back-end (database) to store patients, doctors, classifications, disease records.

- Improve “System Checker” logic (AI/ML?) or more advanced disease classification (if desired).

- Make it responsive / mobile-friendly if not already.

- Add authentication, role‐based access (hospital staff vs patient) for real deployment.

- Enhance with APIs (e.g., doctor availability, appointment booking).
